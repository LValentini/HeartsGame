    frogx - Free Online Gaming Service for XMPP <http://frogx.org/>
    ===============================================================

The project is planning to offer a external XMPP component which enables Jabber
servers to support Multi-User Gaming services. For Openfire [1] server there are
also plugins to support and manage Multi-User Gaming Services within the admin
console.
A Tic-tac-toe game plugin is also included and can be testet with Pidgin [2] 
and the Pidgin Game Plugins [3].


    Requirements
    ------------

- Java 5 (JDK 1.5) or greater <http://java.sun.com/>.
- Maven 2.1 or greater <http://maven.apache.org/>.


    Building the Source
    -------------------

- Ensure your JAVA_HOME variable locates to your actual Java directory:
        $JAVA_HOME/bin/java -version

- For the first time you need to install the packages in the following order:
        1. frogx-api
        2. frogx-core
        3. frogx-plugin-extension
        4. maven-frogx-service-plugin

- The packages can be installed by navigating into the subdirectory and invoking:
        mvn install

- After installing the required packages you can navigate to the parent directory
  and install the other packages within the local maven repository:
        mvn install

- Now you should find packages for the external component in the folder:
        frogx-component/target
